🧪 How to Run the Project

 Requirements:
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

 Local Setup:
 Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-team/farmai

 Navigate into the project folder
cd farmai


Option 1: Open Manually

Locate the index.html file in the project folder.

Open it directly in your browser.

Option 2: (Recommended) Use Live Server

Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.

Right-click on index.html → Open with Live Server.

This automatically refreshes the page on every save!

No additional installation or backend server is required — it’s a pure static HTML/CSS/JS project.
